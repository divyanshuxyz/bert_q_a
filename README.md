A BERT model that can read PDF and answer questions from them is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

Information retrieval: BERT can be used to quickly and accurately search for information in large documents, such as PDF files.
Question answering: BERT can be used to answer questions about the content of a PDF file, even if the questions are open ended, challenging, or strange.
Document summarization: BERT can be used to generate summaries of PDF files, highlighting the most important information.
Machine translation: BERT can be used to translate PDF files from one language to another.

To work, a BERT model that can read PDF and answer questions from them needs to be first trained on a dataset of PDF files and associated questions and answers. Once the model is trained, it can be used to read new PDF files and answer questions about them.

Here is a small description of how a BERT model can be used to read PDF and answer questions from them:

The PDF file is first converted to a text format.
The text is then split into tokens.
The tokens are converted into numerical representations using a process called tokenization.
The numerical representations are then fed to the BERT model.
The BERT model produces a sequence of vectors, where each vector represents the meaning of a corresponding token in the input sequence.
The vectors are then processed by a downstream task-specific model, such as a question answering model.
The question answering model produces an answer to the question, which is then returned to the user.

Here is an example of how a BERT model that can read PDF and answer questions from them could be used:

Question: Who is the prime minister of India?

PDF file: France is a country in Western Europe. Its capital is Paris.

Answer: Shri Narendra Modi.
